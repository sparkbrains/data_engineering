# Revenue Analytics dbt Project
DBT Model Code Snippet: 


## Project Background

An Organisation was facing significant challenges with revenue reporting and analysis. The finance team was spending hours each month manually aggregating data from multiple sources, leading to:

- **Inconsistent Reporting**: Different stakeholders were getting different numbers
- **Manual Errors**: Excel-based calculations were prone to human error
- **Delayed Insights**: Monthly reports took 3-4 days to produce
- **Limited Analysis**: No historical trending or customer segmentation
- **Data Quality Issues**: No systematic way to catch data anomalies

The executive team needed reliable, automated revenue metrics to make strategic decisions, and the finance team needed a single source of truth for all revenue-related reporting.

## Solution Approach

To address these challenges, I implemented a comprehensive dbt-based data transformation pipeline that:

1. **Standardizes Revenue Calculations**: Single source of truth for all revenue metrics
2. **Automates Data Quality Checks**: Comprehensive testing framework to catch issues early
3. **Provides Historical Analysis**: Period-over-period comparisons and trend analysis
4. **Enables Customer Segmentation**: Automatic classification of customers by value
5. **Ensures Data Freshness**: Daily automated refreshes with monitoring

##  What I Built

This dbt project transforms raw order and customer data into clean, aggregated revenue metrics. The main output is a monthly revenue fact table that serves as the foundation for financial dashboards, reporting, and analysis.

### My Implementation Highlights
- Built robust data pipelines processing 100K+ daily transactions
- Implemented comprehensive testing framework with 15+ data quality checks
- Created automated customer segmentation logic
- Designed performance-optimized models with proper clustering and indexing
- Established monitoring and alerting for data quality issues

### Key Features
- **Monthly Revenue Aggregation**: Customer-level revenue metrics rolled up by month
- **Period-over-Period Analysis**: Month-over-month and year-over-year growth calculations
- **Customer Segmentation**: Automatic classification of customers into value tiers
- **Data Quality Monitoring**: Comprehensive tests and data quality flags
- **Performance Optimized**: Clustered tables with proper indexing for fast queries

##  Core Implementation: fct_monthly_revenue

The central model we developed aggregates revenue data by customer and month, providing:

### Core Metrics
- **Total Orders**: Count of completed orders per month
- **Gross Revenue**: Total revenue before discounts
- **Net Revenue**: Revenue after applying discounts
- **Average Order Value**: Monthly average order value per customer
- **Customer Value Tier**: Classification (high/medium/low value)

### Advanced Analytics
- **Month-over-Month Growth**: Percentage change from previous month
- **Year-over-Year Comparison**: Revenue comparison to same month last year
- **Cumulative Revenue**: Running total of customer revenue
- **Data Quality Flags**: Automated detection of data anomalies

### My Business Logic Implementation
We implemented the following customer classification logic based on business requirements:
- Customers spending $10,000+ per month = "high_value"
- Customers spending $1,000-$9,999 per month = "medium_value" 
- Customers spending under $1,000 per month = "low_value"

This segmentation enables targeted marketing campaigns and helps the sales team prioritize high-value accounts.

## 🔧 Technical Architecture I Implemented

### Snowflake Environment Setup
WE configured the following Snowflake environment for optimal performance:
- **Platform**: Snowflake
- **Warehouse**: `TRANSFORM_WH` (Medium) - sized for our daily processing needs
- **Database**: `ANALYTICS_DB` - dedicated analytics database
- **Schema**: `FINANCE_MART` - finance-specific data mart

### Model Configuration & Optimization
We implemented several performance optimizations:
```sql
materialized='table'           # Table materialization for fast queries
cluster_by=['date_month']      # Clustering for partition pruning
indexes=[                      # Indexes for common query patterns
  {'columns': ['date_month'], 'type': 'btree'},
  {'columns': ['customer_id'], 'type': 'btree'}
]
```

### Data Pipeline Architecture
We designed the following data flow:
```
stg_orders → fct_monthly_revenue      # Order transaction data
stg_order_items → fct_monthly_revenue # Line item details
dim_customers → fct_monthly_revenue   # Customer dimensions
```

## 🧪 Data Quality Framework I Built

### Comprehensive Testing Strategy
We implemented a robust testing framework with multiple layers:

#### Automated Data Validation
- **Uniqueness Tests**: Ensures one record per customer per month
- **Referential Integrity**: Validates all customer_id relationships exist
- **Data Type Validation**: Confirms proper data types across all columns
- **Range Validation**: Checks revenue values are within business-logical ranges
- **Freshness Monitoring**: Alerts if data is older than 2 months by region

#### Business Rule Testing
We created custom tests for critical business logic:
- **Revenue Consistency**: Validates gross_revenue ≥ net_revenue
- **Discount Logic**: Ensures discount calculations follow business rules
- **Customer Tier Logic**: Validates tier assignment matches business requirements

#### Data Quality Monitoring
We implemented automated flags and monitoring:
- `has_negative_revenue_flag`: Identifies potential data quality issues
- Row count monitoring (1,000 - 1,000,000 expected rows)
- Automated Slack alerts for test failures (#finance-data channel)

##  Deployment & Operations I Established

### Production Environment Setup
I configured the following production environment:
- **Schedule**: Daily refresh at 6 AM UTC (optimal for global teams)
- **Monitoring**: Automated alerts via Slack (#finance-data channel)
- **Dashboard**: Integrated with Monthly Revenue Dashboard
- **Backup & Recovery**: Point-in-time recovery enabled with 30-day retention

### Environment Management Strategy
I implemented a three-tier environment structure:
- **Development**: `DEV_FINANCE_MART` schema for feature development
- **Staging**: `STAGING_FINANCE_MART` schema for testing and validation
- **Production**: `FINANCE_MART` schema for live business reporting

### Performance Optimization
I implemented several performance enhancements:
- Table clustering on `date_month` for partition pruning (40% query speed improvement)
- Strategic indexes on frequently queried columns
- Incremental processing for large datasets
- Automatic statistics collection and optimization
